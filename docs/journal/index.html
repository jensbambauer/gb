<h1 id="geebird-amp-bamby-announces-the-release-of-quot-mart-quot-">Geebird&amp;Bamby™ Announces the Release of &quot;Mart&quot;</h1>
<p>Geebird&amp;Bamby™ announces the release of the first three pieces of their new fine art photography series <a href="../mart/index.html">&quot;Mart&quot;</a>. Each piece is limited to 25 prints and presented in life-size at a dimension of 180cm x 112cm / 71&quot; x 44&quot;.</p>
<p>The series &quot;Mart&quot; by Geebird&amp;Bamby™ explores aspects of consumer culture by staging an ostensibly lighthearted, material world inside the American supermarket of the late 20th century.</p>
<p>The series’ juxtaposition of truth and invention as well as abundance and depletion echo the struggles of man with a life overexposed to advertising, torn between desire and disgust, sometimes blatantly so, at other times concealed. </p>
<p>The ongoing fine art photography series is presented in life-size at a dimension of 180cm x 112cm / 71&quot; x 44“. The photographic exposures are released in a single edition of 25 per piece. In addition to the Lambda C-Prints, Aluminum Dibond® and framing options are available.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, &quot;Mart&quot; is exclusively available for purchase in our online store, shipping worldwide. Our previous customers enjoy preferred order processing.</p>

<h1 id="welcome-to-our-new-website-and-online-store">Welcome to Our New Website and Online Store</h1>
<p>We’d like to take a minute to welcome you to our new website and online store. Designed and developed from scratch and in-house, there are two major advancements that we’d like to focus on in this post. The presentation of the artworks and our custom shipping costs calculation engine.</p>
<p>First off, the presentation of the artworks. Presenting art online is hard, especially considering the plethora of different devices websites are viewed on these days. While viewing art online may never live up to experiencing the actual artworks in person, there are certainly better ways than slapping a small image on a white page and calling it a day. Going big comes with its own challenges, however. We opted against utilizing any browser scaling of images, as today’s browsers are just very bad at it - if you’re a stickler for details that is. We ended up with five media queries for the main stage of the website. Depending on browser window size, desktops are served three different image sizes (1024px, 1440px and 1680px), iPad and other modern tablets receive 2048px, and we serve a massive 2880px image (the premier choice for print-it-yourself art lovers) to high-resolution desktops such as the iMac 4K/5K. To put this into perspective, where the old website used three images per artwork, our new site uses 25. Furthermore, all other images on the website are served in high resolution. Intelligent pre-loaders ensure everything should be smooth on your end, given you have a decent connection. While we do not offer a dedicated mobile version for now, we ensured the interface allows viewing and shopping artworks on modern smartphones. That is not to say we don’t have plans for mobile.</p>
<p>Second, the new store is capable of calculating the shipping costs for any item combination for our three regions (United States, European Union, World) - that is before you enter your address. Showing shipping costs up front has always been a high priority for us, nevertheless it’s very hard to get right (hence our long-lasting free shipping deal, sorry you’re late). The items you intend to purchase may be of significantly different size and weight: take a large framed piece in a wooden crate plus a print in a standard cardboard tube. Additionally, UPS® tariffs are complicated. Jens coded a formula that ensures you get a precise quote for the shipping costs for whatever’s in your cart, right at the moment you add an item. This includes switching to DHL whenever possible (DHL is cheaper, however, most of our offerings are too large to ship with DHL). While free shipping is a thing of the past for us, that doesn’t mean we don’t subsidize shipping costs to some extent. The UPS® list price for shipping a framed piece of „The New World“ is well north of 250€, but you will find out that you’ll end up paying a lot less than that. In part that’s due to our monthly volume, but it’s also because we’re being nice here. Everybody hates shipping costs - but they’re unavoidable, unfortunately (unless you opt to pick up your order). We will continuously monitor the market and incorporate changes that will lower shipping costs. Watch this space for announcements.</p>

<h1 id="new-finishing-options-for-quot-the-new-world-quot-">New Finishing Options for &quot;The New World&quot;</h1>
<p>With the launch of our new store, additional finishing options become available for our series &quot;The New World&quot;. Previously, we offered the series exclusively in the Aluminum Dibond® production technique. For the first time, you may now order prints as well as three different framings. Nothing changes for the editions, the new options are simply available for the remaining serial numbers of each piece.</p>
<p>For the Lambda C-Prints, you have the option of glossy or matte, the latter is recommended if you plan to have the piece framed by a shop of your choice - consider potential shipping costs savings by going this route. While glossy paper enables a slightly higher contrast, matte paper effectively minimizes reflections when framed under glass. A white border of 1cm / 0.4“ around the print is added to allow easy framing. Every print comes with a signed certificate of authenticity carrying the serial number.</p>
<p>Our frames are hand built and function as an addition to the Aluminum Dibond® production technique, allowing a mat-less frame with the piece extending all the way to the edges. The added wooden frame measures 2cm / 0.8“ in width and 3cm / 1.2“ in depth. There are three available options: black (oak wood), white (maple wood) and maple. You’re free to choose a combination that benefits the piece and suits your space. The framed piece weighs 6 kg / 13.2 lbs and comes with a signed certificate of authenticity carrying the serial number.</p>
<p>More informations on all finishing options, including technical drawings, are available on the detail page of each artwork.</p>

<h1 id="making-quot-mart-quot-">Making &quot;Mart&quot;</h1>
<p>The idea for &quot;Mart&quot; dates all the way back to 2009, around the same time &quot;The New World&quot; was conceived. While it was clear from the beginning that the pieces would present shelves full of merchandise, this early note provides a vague idea of the inspiration behind &quot;Mart&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;An elderly lady looking a million dollars. She remembers her grand life through the haze of daily happy hours at the formal dining room. An empty chair next to her. Prosperity and destruction are served on gold-edged plates around here. As the sun sets, she’s taking her Cadillac to the supermarket.&quot;</p>
<p>At the time, however, the realization of this vision seemed all but intimidating to us. It took the learnings from the creation of &quot;The New World&quot;, especially regarding typography, for the execution to become attainable. Work on &quot;Mart&quot; began in 2014 would and spread over three years. This includes the invention of the depicted brands, the packaging design and the composition of the final shelves. Innumerable iterations would be required for each of these steps, as they turned out to inform each other significantly.</p>
<p>The process we developed to bring &quot;Mart&quot; to life allowed us to work on a somewhat excessive level of detail (these are 125 megapixel images), exploiting the native resolution of the Durst Lambda, the photomechanical printer utilized to expose the images. The shelf system we established will allow us to show products of any size within the same format, while always presenting them accurately in their original size.</p>
<p>With three pieces released, we’re not done with &quot;Mart&quot; yet. There is literally more in store, and there are already hints as to what the next ones may be scattered on our website. At this time, however, we focus on the production and exhibition of the first three pieces - the sheer size of them prevents exhibiting, handling and shipping them from being an afterthought.</p>

<h1 id="riding-the-ghost-train">Riding the Ghost Train</h1>
<p>By Robert G. Achtel</p>
<p>In 1995, at the age of 14, I spent a weekend in Miami with my parents. My father (*1936, Berlin), a business traveler for the past four decades, booked the seaside hotel &quot;Dezerland&quot; (originally &quot;Biltmore Terrace&quot;, Morris Lapidus, 1951). Upon arrival, I was in shock. The place was sleazy. A decorative Cadillac in the lobby. A pink Eldorado next to a fiberglass Elvis statue. &quot;This is the real thing kid! Because it&#x27;s just like it used to be.&quot; my father explained. I didn&#x27;t get it at all. By the time we got to the rooms, the conversation had ceased. He had a stiff drink on the balcony, I went to bed. He sat quietly, watching the ocean. He certainly wasn&#x27;t too concerned about his spoiled son&#x27;s preferences. </p>
<p>The years went by and in 2011, when a friend and I made a stopover in Miami, I booked the Dezerland. I was curious how it had held up. Elvis was still there, so was the Eldorado. The rooms were stripped down, the tiled floors reminded me of a sobering cell, but considering that it had been converted into a low budget spring break hotel, it all made sense. That night we went out, and since the Dezerland is in North Beach, we took the bus. On line 120 we eventually met two local girls which took us to the &quot;Purdy Lounge&quot;. Good times.</p>
<p>We took a cab back to the Dezerland at sunrise. When we passed the postmodern resort hotels on Collins Ave, I remembered the trip with my parents and the &quot;real thing&quot; speech of my dad. I wondered, when did things stop being real? Referencing contemporary history, one may be enticed to draw a line somewhere in the transition between Modernism and Postmodernism. Connect it to the radical events that happened during that time, Neil and Buzz walk on the moon, Jack and John die by the gun. The future of the past derailed like a ghost train. Enjoy scheming cynical business models while you stay at The Venetian in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<p>In 1995, the Dezerland hadn&#x27;t gotten the memo. It had seen better days for sure, but their spirit lingered on. I eventually realized that this was what my father liked about it. A memento of easier, more modest times, miles north of the crater Postmodernism left when it hit Miami Beach. As he watched the moonlit waves crashing on the shore, he certainly wasn&#x27;t minding the historical context I am alleging here. It was the year of his retirement, he had his very own considerations to make.</p>
<p>The Biltmore Terrace was an early work of Morris Lapidus (1902, Odessa, now Ukraine), self-proclaimed &quot;Architect of the American Dream&quot;. One of 250 Hotels he built, including The Fountainebleau (1954), featured in &quot;James Bond: Goldfinger&quot; (1964). His work defined the architectural style of Miami Beach. Although his buildings relied on many functional principles, Modernists loathed the arguably ostentatious style he developed, openly vilifying it as vulgar and incompetent during an AIA meeting in 1963. In spite of his enormous success, he remained an outsider to the American architectural establishment for many years. It figures that decades later, his work was eventually re-evaluated and Lapidus became a celebrated pioneer of Postmodernism. By that time, Lapidus had already given up hope for his work to be recognized and had burned most of his archive after he retired in 1984. Ironically, when Paul Rudolph (1918, Elkton, KY), a pioneer of Modernism and vocal critic of Lapidus’ work, downright trailblazed his own way out of Modernism, he was subject to harsh critique as well. Assessing his Brutalist Yale Art &amp; Architecture building (1958), his peers sensed a betrayal towards Modernism. Again, it would take decades until the ingenuity of his later work was acknowledged.</p>
<p>We arrive at the Dezerland, and as we get out of the cab to seagull squeaks, I wondered if my line of thought made any sense. Postmodernism betrays, but only those who want to be betrayed. The Venetian isn&#x27;t Venice. Times are changing, and it&#x27;s human to feel a sentimentality for the past, all the more for your own younger days. But still, there&#x27;s no denying the widespread lack of integrity one has to put up with today. And in a world of follower counts, a fiberglass Elvis statue is a welcome reminder. He&#x27;s the king, but his kingdom is lost.</p>
<p>The next day was unavoidably affected by a hangover. From the proceedings at the Purdy Lounge and my dazed attempt to blame Postmodernism for the demise of the world. What is there to say about a period named merely after where it&#x27;s coming from, not where it&#x27;s going. It&#x27;s so easy to despise when you admit how the Modernists ideals were replaced by an insatiable hunger for profit and growth. In the words of Hunter S. Thompson: &quot;For a loser, Vegas is the meanest town on earth.&quot;</p>
<p>But then again, Postmodernism merely echoes the increasingly complicated world of the late 20th century. And while we might be aboard this ghost train, we still managed to have a good time. Maybe, you have to come to terms. There are no easy answers. Architectural styles, just like life itself, are in a constant state of flux, shaped by generational battles. Architects are leaving their marks, and some of these inevitably become monuments to their creator&#x27;s hopes and fears. Rudolph&#x27;s daring Brutalist aesthetic and Lapidus&#x27; lifelong pursuit of recognition eventually inspired our piece <a href="http://store.geebirdandbamby.com/the-new-world/fox-theatre/index.html">&quot;Fox Theatre&quot;</a> (2011). </p>
<p>For the Dezerland, however, the end was bleak. It closed in 2013 after being entirely run down by the mode of operation I had witnessed in 2011. Miami developer Terra Group presented a comprehensive plan to restore and preserve it under its original name, adding an expansion that would more than double its capacity. Once the plan was approved by Miami&#x27;s Design Review Board and presented to the North Shore Historic District Neighborhood Association, the developer quickly changed its intentions in favor of 200ft luxury condo tower designed by Renzo Piano. Due to the lack of a historic designation for the structure, papers were signed and the Dezerland was demolished.</p>

<h1 id="interview-for-the-futurist-milan-italy">Interview for The Futurist, Milan, Italy</h1>
<p>This interview with Robert was published in the Italian luxury lifestyle magazine &quot;The Futurist&quot; in August 2016. It was conducted by editor Marianna Redaelli.</p>
<p><em>At first glance it may appear that certain elements are projected in &quot;non-places&quot; and &quot;out of time&quot;. There is no human presence; the architecture has a historical connotation recognizable but the context is alienating; the light is always dazzling, almost no shadows, it can be assumed a daytime but not a season. Now I ask you, if you agree with these first observations, to give them a deeper reading.</em></p>
<p>These observations are attentive, I like the expression &quot;out of time&quot;. You mention you almost don’t see shadows, that is because it’s mid day and the shadows cast by the sun are short. Being stripped of further references of time and place is an essential element of &quot;The New World&quot;, so instead of portrayals, maybe try to view them as slightly faded memories of places.</p>
<p>Memories are often confined to the subjectively relevant information, they might include emotions and omit the circumstances, hence the barren stages. Architecture to me is a reflection of the society a building originates in, its purpose, its architects convictions, etc., thus I have to disagree with the absence of human presence you mention; of course there are no people visible, but looking at our pieces, even though they’re just buildings, you can’t deny the human drama they reflect.</p>
<p><em>How and when was the &quot;The New World&quot; project born and developed? From sociocultural observations? Why the choice of a unique technique that may call &quot;fragmented&quot;? They are not technically photographs even though they represent architecture with the same perspective and precision of a photograph.</em></p>
<p>I have been taking pictures of the American roadside since the late 1990s, and for reasons unknown to me, I was always drawn to desolate places that reflected the demise of modernism and the cynical promises of postmodernism - long before I even acquainted myself with the contemporary history of architecture. I became obsessed with the irony often displayed in the American (architectural) landscape. However, the images that emerged in my head could not possibly be achieved in the wild. Also, I wanted to create buildings that, while remaining somewhat archetypal, had an iconic appeal - without using existing brands.</p>
<p>In 2009 I decided I am not going to dedicate my professional life to advertisement, at least not all of it. I quit my full-time agency job and focused on creating &quot;The New World&quot;. Digital image compositing enabled me to completely deconstruct and reassemble architectural elements that I had photographed, allowing me to create ostensively mundane, yet non-existing, original buildings. My education and training in design was crucial for contriving the logos, posters, signs etc., as each of those were created mostly from scratch.</p>
<p>This is of course a very brief rundown of the origins of &quot;The New World&quot;, and I don’t really believe it’s the tools that define the work. To me, the most important tool is being able to visualize an almost finished piece in my head, to develop structured methods that allow this vision, which may seem impossible to achieve at first, to come to life, always learning along the way.</p>
<p><em>Italo Calvino, a famous Italian writer, wrote a book in the 70&#x27;s called &quot;The Invisible Cities“. The narrative structure is very complex and &quot;combinatorial“, the reader is left with the game of finding solutions or hidden combinations. Marco Polo describes the real cities, imaginary, all fruit of his imagination, &quot;City of Memory&quot; and „Hidden City&quot;. &quot;Everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire, or its reverse, a fear. Cities such as dreams are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules absurd, misleading perspectives, and everything hides another&quot;. Did you find some similarity with your concept? And your outlook, your narrative, is it dynamic or static? What are the possible developments? What is your invisible city?</em></p>
<p>As I haven’t read Calvino, I won’t comment on the narrative structure of &quot;Invisible Cities&quot; or its combinatorial nature; I am not sure &quot;The New World&quot; qualifies for a credible comparison here. The pieces of &quot;The New World&quot; may be combined to a vision of a city, but at the same time, they stand on their own. Of greater interest to me is the fact that the book was written in the 1970s, the dawn of postmodernism, the time when people began to lose faith in modernist ideals, which is somewhat mirrored in the book by the oppressive, dismal state the cities Marco Polo describes in the book are in.</p>
<p>I agree that desires and fears define man and therefore his endeavors. Further, I believe that everything we create is shaped by obsessions that are part of our psyche, even if that’s not initially visible on the surface, or concealed on purpose. It’s these obsessions that interest me as an artist, and by acknowledging them, I feel relieved from the fact that we’re pretty lost. </p>
<p>Architecture, or buildings, served me well as a sort of canvas, and while &quot;The New World&quot; certainly isn’t finished yet, the next five pieces are quasi fixed, I am currently working with other subjects. However, these are part of the same narrative. Few people ever manage to escape their demons, I suppose.</p>

<h1 id="the-old-man-and-the-diner">The Old Man and the Diner</h1>
<p>By Robert G. Achtel</p>
<p>During a stay in Sarasota, Florida in the spring of 2009, I prepared to shoot the front of a Waffle House restaurant on U.S. 41, the Tamiami Trail, for what would later become <a href="../the-new-world/oasis-diner/index.html">&quot;Oasis Diner“</a>.</p>
<p>On the day of the shoot I had not figured out yet where the piece would go, but I was attracted by the aesthetics of the typical black steel and glass facade. Leaving the house, I met my friend Vern. He’d be around his garage at that time of the day, fixing up gear or taking care of his yard. Retired from his director position at PPG Industries, Vern had become a published botanical photographer, documenting orchids for the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens.</p>
<p>Discussing my schedule for the day and mentioning the Waffle House I was about to shoot, Vern told me about his friend, mystery writer Stuart M. Kaminsky (* 1934 in Chicago, IL † 2009 in St. Louis, MO). He revealed that Mr. Kaminsky used to write at that Waffle House during the night and that he also used it as a setting for his books. Of course, as one of his leading characters, a depressive process server by the name of Lew Fonesca, was a Sarasota resident.</p>
<p>I left inspired to capture this seemingly mundane restaurant, just having learned that it had already transcended into fiction and pop culture. When I arrived at the site, the Waffle House had just been closed down and the signage was about to be removed. A close call, but not uncommon during the recession of 2009. I also shot an abandoned Winn Dixie and a K-Mart during that stay, the latter became <a href="../the-new-world/all-mart/index.html">&quot;All Mart&quot;</a> - both buildings have vanished since. It was during that time that ephemerality became a major theme of &quot;The New World&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Oasis Diner&quot; eventually turned into a piece about saying your goodbyes, getting things in order, a place for that one last talk you may have with someone. I decided that it should be located in a remote, deserted setting and shot the material for the background at the Vasquez Rocks just outside of Palmdale, California, in February 2012.  </p>
<p>I first met Vern in 1994. Ever since, I cherish the episodes he shared of the life he spent with his brilliant wife Renata. It would’ve been easy to mistake Vern for a grumpy old man. Having ticked off most of life’s boxes, easily allowing him and Renata to spend their retirement on their own terms, he just couldn’t let go. Let go of his disappointment with people and the way of the world. He wasn’t bitter, he just saw straight through many things you’re not supposed to. I was still growing up, and as a kid you get told that everything is going to be alright in the end. Looking into his old eyes, I eventually realized that that’s probably a lie.</p>
<p>Our last correspondence was about his recent E-Mail issues. He summarized: &quot;The Spam was too much, but such is life.&quot;</p>

<h1 id="geebird-amp-bamby-announces-collaboration-with-l-horizon-resort-and-spa-in-palm-springs-california">Geebird&amp;Bamby™ Announces Collaboration with L’Horizon Resort and Spa in Palm Springs, California</h1>
<p>We are happy to announce our collaboration with the <a href="http://www.lhorizonpalmsprings.com">L’Horizon Resort and Spa</a>, a recently re-envisioned luxury boutique hotel in Palm Springs, California. Originally designed by desert modern architect William F. Cody in 1952, the L’Horizon was a favorite destination spot in Hollywood’s golden era, attracting celebrities like Marilyn Monroe as well as several U.S. Presidents. </p>
<p>&quot;L’Horizon is this perfect little jewel of low density bungalows spread out over several acres. Its iconic and well preserved architecture along with its rich history make it completely unique. There is nothing else like it.&quot; - Steve Hermann, Owner</p>
<p>Located on 1050 East Palm Canyon Drive, the L’Horizon, which houses the Michelin-starred Restaurant SO.PA, is the only property in the Coachella Valley to be accepted into the <a href="http://www.lhw.com">Leading Hotels of the World</a> group. As part of our collaboration, numerous pieces of &quot;The New World&quot; are exhibited throughout the property. Taking into account the concept, architecture and history of the L’Horizon, we believe it’s a decent place for our pieces to reside.</p>
<p>In the 2016 Condé Nast Traveler Readers’ Choice Awards, the L’Horizon has been voted #1 resort in Southern California and #2 resort in the United States. Additionally, it has been declared the top choice in Palms Springs by Forbes Magazine.</p>

<h1 id="interview-for-ville-collective-tokyo-japan">Interview for Ville Collective, Tokyo, Japan</h1>
<p>The following interview was conducted by Midori Fujihira of Ville Collective, Tokyo, Japan in September 2014.</p>
<p><em>Please introduce yourself &amp; &quot;The New World&quot; to Japanese and International readers.</em></p>
<p>My name is Robert, I’m artist behind &quot;The New World&quot;, an ongoing fine art series that depicts buildings from the American post-war period. While the series is based on our architectural photography, they are technically not photographs, as none of the portrayed buildings actually exist. I am working with a partner, Jens Bambauer, whom I met in college in 2006. Together, we founded Geebird&amp;Bamby in 2011.</p>
<p><em>How do you feel if people find your works on social media and your work is recognized on internet?</em></p>
<p>Of course it is a good thing to see your work shared on the internet, especially when it happens in unexpected places or context. It is the internet though, and while they might seem as the currency of these days, likes and shares at times feel rather random and shallow to me. Exhibiting the actual artworks, seeing people react to them, having conversations about whatever they see in them - that is the true virtue of creating art.</p>
<p><em>What is the most important process in the production of &quot;The New World?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Every piece has an underlying theme, sometimes of essential nature, other times  personal - or both. The most difficult and therefore one of the more important stages of processes is to embody that theme in a fairly mundane building. Whether it is making a bold statement on its facade or confining something inside. Many creative decisions, the obvious and the not so obvious, are led by that intent. It is a fine line between giving the building a story to tell, but at the same time, making it keep a secret. And as with all things in life, you do not always succeed.</p>
<p><em>Based in Germany, what’s your view on American culture and history?</em></p>
<p>Growing up in West Germany, the lines were drawn pretty clear for a cold war kid and it is fair to say that &quot;The New World&quot; is in part reminiscent of that era. In today’s postmodern age however, those lines become increasingly blurred, and many givens are to be questioned. I believe my efforts in that should be visible in my work, but in how far that is a statement on American culture, that is up to you. But I may say that by titling &quot;The New World&quot;, it should be somewhat obvious that I see America less as a political entity than as a human effort to create something new, detached from old rules and convictions. So whatever you take away, consider that it is more a comment on humanity itself than on America.</p>
<p><em>Could you tell us your future vision for the Geebird&amp;Bamby Website?</em></p>
<p>Obviously the website comes second to the actual work we are showing on it. Our current site has been online for almost three years and a redesign has been planned for quite a while now. We will have a section that allows more insight into the process and preview new work, especially to our collectors, something we have not been very good at in the past. The vision has not changed however, the website has enabled us to ship our work into many parts of the world and that never gets boring.</p>
