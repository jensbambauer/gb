# Geebird&Bamby™ Announces Collaboration with L’Horizon Resort and Spa in Palm Springs, California

We are happy to announce our collaboration with the [L’Horizon Resort and Spa](http://www.lhorizonpalmsprings.com), a recently re-envisioned luxury boutique hotel in Palm Springs, California. Originally designed by desert modern architect William F. Cody in 1952, the L’Horizon was a favorite destination spot in Hollywood’s golden era, attracting celebrities like Marilyn Monroe as well as several U.S. Presidents. 

"L’Horizon is this perfect little jewel of low density bungalows spread out over several acres. Its iconic and well preserved architecture along with its rich history make it completely unique. There is nothing else like it." - Steve Hermann, Owner

Located on 1050 East Palm Canyon Drive, the L’Horizon is the only property in Palm Springs to be accepted into the [Leading Hotels of the World](http://www.lhw.com) group. As of this writing, 40 pieces of "The New World" are exhibited throughout the hotel. Taking into account the concept, architecture and the history of the L’Horizon, it is hard to imagine a better place for pieces of "The New World" to reside.

In the 2016 [Condé Nast Traveler Readers’ Choice Awards](http://www.cntraveler.com/travel-awards/readers-choice-awards), the L’Horizon has been voted #1 resort in Southern California and #2 resort in the United States. Additionally, it has been declared the top choice in Palms Springs by Forbes Magazine.
