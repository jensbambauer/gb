# Geebird&Bamby™ Announces the Release of "Mart"

Geebird&Bamby™ announces the release of the first three pieces of their new fine art photography series ["Mart"](https://store.geebirdandbamby.com/mart/index.html). Each piece is limited to 25 prints and presented in life-size at a dimension of 180cm x 114cm / 71" x 45".

The series "Mart" by Geebird&Bamby™ explores aspects of consumer culture by staging an ostensibly lighthearted, material world inside the American supermarket of the late 20th century.

The series’ juxtaposition of truth and invention as well as abundance and depletion echo the struggles of man with a life overexposed to advertising, torn between desire and disgust, sometimes blatantly so, at other times concealed. 

The ongoing fine art photography series is presented in life-size at a dimension of 180cm x 114cm / 71" x 45". The photographic exposures are limited to 25 per piece. In addition to the Durst Lambda exposures, Aluminum Dibond® and framing options are available.

At the time of this writing, "Mart" is exclusively available for purchase in our online store, shipping worldwide. Our previous customers enjoy preferred order processing.
