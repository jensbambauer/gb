# New Certificates from December 2017

All pieces sold after December 1st, 2017 carry a redesigned certificate of authenticity. It is the second update of our certificate following the first revision in January 2014.

The new design accommodates certification of multiple seriesâ€™ and features improved unforgeability. The now digitally applied stamp reads the date of certification upon close inspection. Please note that for print orders, the certificate will be provided separately, allowing you to apply it after the piece has been framed.

Nothing changes for the editions, the new certificate will be issued for the remaining serial numbers of each piece.
