# New Finishing Options for "The New World"

With the launch of our new store, additional finishing options become available for our series "The New World". Previously, we offered the series exclusively in the Aluminum Dibond® production technique. For the first time, you may now order prints as well as three different framings. Nothing changes for the editions, the new options are simply available for the remaining serial numbers of each piece.

For the prints, you have the option of glossy or matte, the latter is recommended if you plan to have the piece framed by a shop of your choice - consider potential shipping costs savings by going this route. While glossy paper enables a slightly higher contrast, matte paper effectively minimizes reflections when framed under glass. A white border of 1cm / 0.4“ around the print is added to allow easy framing. Every print comes with a signed certificate of authenticity carrying the serial number.

Our frames are hand built and function as an addition to the Aluminum Dibond® production technique, allowing a mat-less frame with the piece extending all the way to the edges. The added wooden frame measures 2cm / 0.8“ in width and 3cm / 1.2“ in depth. There are three available options: black (oak wood), white (maple wood) and maple. You’re free to choose a combination that benefits the piece and suits your space. The framed piece weighs 6 kg / 13.2 lbs and comes with a signed certificate of authenticity carrying the serial number.

More informations on all finishing options, including technical drawings, are available on the detail page of each artwork.
