# About Geebird&Bamby™

Initiated in 2009, Geebird&Bamby™ is the creative venture of Robert G. Achtel (b. 1980, Wiesbaden, Germany) and Jens Bambauer (b. 1981, Wetzlar, Germany). Robert and Jens each acquired a B.A. in Multimedia Arts from Middlesex University London and have worked extensively in the advertising industry.

In 2012, Geebird&Bamby™ premiered [“The New World Series I“](../../the-new-world/index.html) at the 13th annual Modernism Week in Palm Springs, California. At the same time, the series became available through the online store, shipping worldwide from their studio in Wiesbaden, Germany. Prior to the release, Geebird&Bamby™ was founded as a limited company (GmbH) in Germany.

Series I made another appearance at the 2012 L.A. Modernism Show in Santa Monica, after which work on Series II commenced. Previewing at the 2013 Palm Springs Modernism Week, Series II premiered in a solo exhibition at CURIO Studio & Collection, the gallery of American contemporary artist Anne Faith Nicholls in Los Angeles in March 2013.

The same year, Geebird&Bamby™ licensed 6 pieces of “The New World“ to LUMAS, a Berlin based gallery with locations worldwide. The “LUMAS SIX“ were released in two new sizes with an edition of 100 each and were part of group shows in Berlin and Seoul. In 2014, “The New World“ was featured in various publications including a six page article in the German photography magazine PHOTOGRAPHIE, and the piece “The Modern Gentleman“ was selected by Diane Keaton as a personal favorite for the Huffington Post. Subsequently, the imagery of “The New World“ became widespread in social media, and the piece [“The Modern Gentleman“](../../the-new-world/modern-gentleman/index.html) quickly sold out all 200 issued prints, while, [“Liquor Swamp“](../../the-new-world/liquor-swamp/index.html) and [“Fox Theatre“](../../the-new-world/fox-theatre/index.html) also became bestsellers at LUMAS. By then, work on the next series [“Mart“](../../mart/index.html) (2017) had already begun while Robert and Jens continued to work on freelance commercial assignments and contribute to creative projects that have been awarded by the ADC, Red Dot, IF and DDC.  

Existing in the art world outside of the traditional gallery system has proven itself viable for Geebird&Bamby™. Connecting to customers and collectors from around the world, attending events such as the recently inaugurated Sarasota Modernism Weekend, and [collaborating](http://store.geebirdandbamby.com/journal/posts/lhorizon-collaboration/index.html) with partners such as the luxury design resort L’Horizon Palm Springs. First and foremost however, it has enabled them to move forward with their art while meeting great people along the way.
